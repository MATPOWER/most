Changes since 5/21/15
---------------------

1/26/16
    - Renamed mops to most, and re-wrote history below accordingly.

12/18/15
    - Fixed fatal crash triggered by failed solve with verbose option off.

12/9/15
    - Added ExpectedTerminalStorageMax, ExpectedTerminalStorageMin to
      md.Storage and StorageData structs. If present ExpectedTerminalStorageAim
      now simply overwrites both.

10/27/15
    - Renamed apply_contingency() to apply_changes() and moved from sopf
      to matpower.

7/17/15
    - Fixed bug preventing proper printing of exit flag on failed solve.

7/10/15
    - Added mpopt as optional second argument to most().

7/9/15
    - Removed all of the old indexing fields from md_init().
    - Added 'most' to have_fcn().
    - Added 'most' options to mpoption(), added mpoption_info_most().

7/2/15
    - Renamed loadmpsd() to loadmd(), mpsd_init() to md_init(), mpsd to md.

7/1/15
    - Added plot_uc() function for plotting unit commitment schedules.

6/19/15
    - Moved lots of mpsopf related files to matpower/dist/most temporarily.
    - Commented out call to oldidx().

6/12/15
    - In loadmpsd() xgd.CommitKey must be non-empty (in addition to just
      being present) in order to process unit commitment fields.

6/10/15
    - Added 'fixed_gencost' field to flow-specific mpc fields to save
      the fixed cost portion that is removed from gencost, to allow
      for computation of full flow-specific generator costs from solution.

6/9/15
    - Modified filter_ramp_transitions() to multiply conditional probability
      of transition by conditional probability of being in source state
      (assuming we've made it to that period) before applying cutoff
      threshold. This will typically cut off more transitions for the same
      threshold value.
    - Minor fixes, updates to plot_gen().

5/21/15
    - Forked development from mpsopfl_fixed_res(), which is currently
      identical except for function names in error messages.
