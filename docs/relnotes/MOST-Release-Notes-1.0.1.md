What's New in MOST 1.0.1
------------------------

#### Released Oct 30, 2018

Below is a summary of the changes since version 1.0 of MOST. See the
[`CHANGES.md`][1] file for all the gory details. For release notes for
previous versions, see Appendix B of the [MOST User's Manual][2].

#### Bugs Fixed:
  - Fix bugs in `plot_uc_data()` resulting in incorrect legends.
  - Fix dimension of `RampWear` cost indexing if `mdi.OpenEnded` is true.
  - Add missing constant term to objective function value reported by
    `most_summary`.

#### Other Changes:
  - LaTeX source code for [MOST User's Manual][2] included in `docs/src`.
  - Updated to use OOP notation for `opt_model` object, and avoid calls
    to deprecated methods, using `init_indexed_name()` and
    `add_lin_constraint()` instead.
  - Updated to use MATPOWER's new quadratic costs in `opt_model` in
    place of the legacy cost model.

#### Incompatible Changes:
  - Failure of the optimization no longer halts execution and jumps to
    the debugger.
  - Requires MATPOWER 7.x or later.
